#Raspberry Pi Dashboard

This repository contains a simple yet useful dashboard that makes use of the Wunderground Weather and NextBus APIs. The dashboard was initially intended for use in a smart mirror project however it could be used for other applications as well. The information displayed within the dashboard can be easily customized by making slight adjustments to the API calls. 

The current layout is best suited for 10.1 inch screen. Please note this is a live project and changes are likely to occur.
