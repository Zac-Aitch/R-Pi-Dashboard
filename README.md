# Raspberry Pi Dashboard

This repository contains a simple yet useful dashboard that makes use of the Wunderground Weather and NextBus APIs. The dashboard was initially intended for use in a smart mirror project however it could be used for other applications as well. The information displayed within the dashboard can be easily customized by making slight adjustments to the API calls. 

The current layout is best suited for 10.1 inch screen. Please note this is a live project and changes are likely to occur. 

## Getting Started

Download and place the following files in the same directory: index.html, mystyle.css


### Prerequisites

Access to web hosting or a web server. I currently have my site hosted through github. I would highly suggest this option if you do not already have a web hosting service. 


### More documentation on the way!
* Making changes to the API calls
* Adjusting for bigger screen size
